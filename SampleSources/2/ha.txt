France captured its second World Cup title after defeating Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 final at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. Despite Croatia outplaying France in the first half, an own goal gave France the advantage early on. Mario Mandžukić had headed the ball into the goal, making it the first own goal in a World Cup final.  Croatia came back immediately to tie the score at 1-1. France answered on a penalty kick following an unfortunate handball by Ivan Perišić before halftime. This call was criticized by many and the video assistant referee was used for the first time in a World Cup.

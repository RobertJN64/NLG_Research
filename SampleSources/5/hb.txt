In 2016, WHO identified Paraguay as one of 21 countries with the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. Through the "E-2020 initiative," WHO is supporting these countries as they scale up activities to become malaria-free. Other E-2020 countries in the Americas include Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico and Suriname.

`Hurricane Michael started as typical weak October Caribbean tropical system. However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall (Figure 1) as an unprecedented (for the region) category 5 hurricane (on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale). Michael made landfall near Tyndall Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 140 knots (161 mph) and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on minimum pressure, Michael is the fourth most-powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.
`

`Scientists at NOAA’s National Hurricane Center conducted a detailed post-storm analysis on all the data available for Hurricane Michael and have determined that the storm’s estimated intensity at landfall was 140 knots (160 mph). This final wind intensity is a 5 knot (5 mph) increase over the operational estimate and makes Michael a category 5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale at the time of landfall on October 10, 2018, near Mexico Beach and Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. Michael is the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States as a category 5 since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and only the fourth on record. The others are the Labor Day Hurricane in 1935 and Hurricane Camille in 1969. Michael is also the strongest hurricane landfall on record in the Florida Panhandle and only the second known category 5 landfall on the northern Gulf coast.
`

`Hurricane Michael was one of the mos devastating hurricanes to ever hit the United States. It first made landfall on October 10, 2018 near Mexico Beach, Florida as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 mph. The storm cause catastrophic damage across the Florida Panhandle and Georgia, with the worst of the damage occurring in the coastal areas of Gulf and Bay counties in Florida. The storm destroyed homes, businesses, and infrastructure in the affected areas and caused at least 69 deaths. The economic cost of the storm is estimated to be around $25 billion, making it one of the most expensive storms in US history.

`France captured its second World Cup title after defeating Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 final at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. Despite Croatia outplaying France in the first half, an own goal gave France the advantage early on. Mario Mandžukić had headed the ball into the goal, making it the first own goal in a World Cup final.  Croatia came back immediately to tie the score at 1-1. France answered on a penalty kick following an unfortunate handball by Ivan Perišić before halftime. This call was criticized by many and the video assistant referee was used for the first time in a World Cup.
`

`France is the champion of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final, besting Croatia by 4 goals to 2. France entered the tournament as a favorite, powered by stars such as Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann, while Croatia was seen as a longshot for victory. "We are world champions and France are going to be on top of the world for next four years," French coach Didier Deschamps said after the game. He called the tournament a "beautiful celebration of football."
`

`The 2018 FIFA World Cup was one of the most exciting and unpredictable tournaments in recent memory. After weeks of thrilling matches and nail-biting finishes, France emerged victorious as the 2018 FIFA World Cup Champions. Led by their star-studded roster of players, France displayed poise and skill throughout the tournament and was able to outlast the competition to secure their second World Cup title. Through a combination of strong team play, outstanding individual performances, and a bit of luck, France was able to overcome the odds and triumph in Russia and become the 2018 FIFA World Cup Champions.

`In summer 2018, a 12-boy soccer team (the Wild Boars) and their coach were celebrating a teammate's birthday when they made a routine trip into the Tham Luang cave in the Chiang Rai province of Thailand. Shortly after they entered, however, heavy rains that showered the region for the past few days flooded the cave and trapped them all inside. After a week without contact, British divers found the group in early July. An international crew of rescuers resolved to rescue the boys before the next monsoon just days away. During those few days, the world watched as all 13 were pulled to safety from the cave and immediately rushed to the hospital.
`

`In June 2018, the world held its breath for 18 days as a group of elite cave divers risked everything to rescue 12 boys and their coach from an underwater cave in Northern Thailand. The boys, who were all members of a soccer team, had gone into a long, winding underground cave with their coach to celebrate one of the boy's birthdays. But it was just before the beginning of the four-month monsoon season, and while they were in the cave, it started to downpour outside. Rain water rushed into the cave, trapping them deep inside.
`

`On June 23rd, a group of 12 boys and their soccer coach were trapped in a cave in Thailand, setting off an international rescue mission that captivated the world. The group, ages 11 to 16, had gone exploring the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Thailand after a soccer match. But they were blocked by rising flood waters after heavy rains. The boys and their coach had been stuck in the cave for nine days before they were found. Rescue workers scrambled to find a way to get the boys out safely, with a complex network of pumps, ropes, and divers all working together. The flooding waters had made the cave increasingly hazardous and the boys were given diving lessons to prepare them for the treacherous journey ahead.

`Hurricane Michael started as typical weak October Caribbean tropical system. However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall (Figure 1) as an unprecedented (for the region) category 5 hurricane (on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale). Michael made landfall near Tyndall Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 140 knots (161 mph) and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on minimum pressure, Michael is the fourth most-powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.
`

`Scientists at NOAA’s National Hurricane Center conducted a detailed post-storm analysis on all the data available for Hurricane Michael and have determined that the storm’s estimated intensity at landfall was 140 knots (160 mph). This final wind intensity is a 5 knot (5 mph) increase over the operational estimate and makes Michael a category 5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale at the time of landfall on October 10, 2018, near Mexico Beach and Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. Michael is the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States as a category 5 since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and only the fourth on record. The others are the Labor Day Hurricane in 1935 and Hurricane Camille in 1969. Michael is also the strongest hurricane landfall on record in the Florida Panhandle and only the second known category 5 landfall on the northern Gulf coast.
`

`Hurricane Michael was one of the mos devastating hurricanes to ever hit the United States. It first made landfall on October 10, 2018 near Mexico Beach, Florida as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 mph. The storm cause catastrophic damage across the Florida Panhandle and Georgia, with the worst of the damage occurring in the coastal areas of Gulf and Bay counties in Florida. The storm destroyed homes, businesses, and infrastructure in the affected areas and caused at least 69 deaths. The economic cost of the storm is estimated to be around $25 billion, making it one of the most expensive storms in US history.
`

`Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 storm, left at least 40 people dead and left tens of thousands without homes and businesses in the Florida Panhandle. As we near this year’s hurricane season, a new kind of storm has emerged. We estimate the cost of Hurricane Michael’s cost at approximately $50 million. Hurricane Michael is the second strongest hurricane in the Atlantic to make landfall over Florida in the last seven months.

`France captured its second World Cup title after defeating Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 final at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. Despite Croatia outplaying France in the first half, an own goal gave France the advantage early on. Mario Mandžukić had headed the ball into the goal, making it the first own goal in a World Cup final.  Croatia came back immediately to tie the score at 1-1. France answered on a penalty kick following an unfortunate handball by Ivan Perišić before halftime. This call was criticized by many and the video assistant referee was used for the first time in a World Cup.
`

`France is the champion of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final, besting Croatia by 4 goals to 2. France entered the tournament as a favorite, powered by stars such as Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann, while Croatia was seen as a longshot for victory. "We are world champions and France are going to be on top of the world for next four years," French coach Didier Deschamps said after the game. He called the tournament a "beautiful celebration of football."
`

`The 2018 FIFA World Cup was one of the most exciting and unpredictable tournaments in recent memory. After weeks of thrilling matches and nail-biting finishes, France emerged victorious as the 2018 FIFA World Cup Champions. Led by their star-studded roster of players, France displayed poise and skill throughout the tournament and was able to outlast the competition to secure their second World Cup title. Through a combination of strong team play, outstanding individual performances, and a bit of luck, France was able to overcome the odds and triumph in Russia and become the 2018 FIFA World Cup Champions.
`

`France captured its second World Cup title after defeating Croatia. It is the fourth title for the French team, after victories in 1998 and 2002. The match ended 1-1 in regular time. The match remained at 1-1 in the Extra Time through the first five minutes. Then, after the halftime break, France took the lead for the first time.

`In summer 2018, a 12-boy soccer team (the Wild Boars) and their coach were celebrating a teammate's birthday when they made a routine trip into the Tham Luang cave in the Chiang Rai province of Thailand. Shortly after they entered, however, heavy rains that showered the region for the past few days flooded the cave and trapped them all inside. After a week without contact, British divers found the group in early July. An international crew of rescuers resolved to rescue the boys before the next monsoon just days away. During those few days, the world watched as all 13 were pulled to safety from the cave and immediately rushed to the hospital.
`

`In June 2018, the world held its breath for 18 days as a group of elite cave divers risked everything to rescue 12 boys and their coach from an underwater cave in Northern Thailand. The boys, who were all members of a soccer team, had gone into a long, winding underground cave with their coach to celebrate one of the boy's birthdays. But it was just before the beginning of the four-month monsoon season, and while they were in the cave, it started to downpour outside. Rain water rushed into the cave, trapping them deep inside.
`

`On June 23rd, a group of 12 boys and their soccer coach were trapped in a cave in Thailand, setting off an international rescue mission that captivated the world. The group, ages 11 to 16, had gone exploring the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Thailand after a soccer match. But they were blocked by rising flood waters after heavy rains. The boys and their coach had been stuck in the cave for nine days before they were found. Rescue workers scrambled to find a way to get the boys out safely, with a complex network of pumps, ropes, and divers all working together. The flooding waters had made the cave increasingly hazardous and the boys were given diving lessons to prepare them for the treacherous journey ahead.
`

`A boys soccer team got trapped in a cave in Thailand. The players stayed in the cave for 16 days during the rescue mission. The parents of boys from a soccer team are suing the government for negligence. After they were rescued, the boys were taken to a facility where they were required to get vaccines.

`Over the past 10 years, Curiosity has driven nearly 18 miles (29 kilometers) and ascended 2,050 feet (625 meters) as it explores Gale Crater and the foothills of Mount Sharp within it. The Mars rover has analyzed 41 rock and soil samples, relying on a suite of science instruments to learn what they reveal about Earth’s rocky sibling. It’s success has pushed a team of engineers to devise ways to minimize wear and tear and keep the rover rolling. In fact, Curiosity’s mission was recently extended for another three years, allowing it to continue among NASA’s fleet of important astrobiological missions.
`

`NASA's Curiosity rover is currently roaming Mars' landscape looking for signs of life and learning about the Red Planet's unique environment. As of Aug. 2, 2022, the rover has traveled 17.64 miles (28.39 kilometers).  Curiosity was launched aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida on Nov. 26, 2011, and landed on Aug. 5, 2012 after taking eight months and 10 days to reach the Red Planet.
`

`The Curiosity rover, also known as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), is a robotic exploration vehicle designed to explore the surface of the planet Mars. It was launched on November 26, 2011 and landed on the planet’s surface on August 6, 2012. It is the first mission to actively explore the Martian surface and is managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Curiosity is fitted with a range of sensors and scientific instruments, including a rock-vaporizing laser and an X-ray spectrometer. Its main objective is to explore the surface of Mars and assess its potential for hosting microbial life. It is also equipped with a camera to take pictures of the planet's surface and a robotic arm for collecting samples for further study.
`

`The Curiosity rover landed successfully in Mars last Friday and after it went through various tests and checks, the scientists have started its main task in order to dig for evidence of past Martian life. The project is called ChemCam, and the mission is to measure the composition of the rocks below the surface.

`In June, Paraguay became the first country in the Americas in nearly 50 years to be declared free of malaria. The World Health Organization (WHO) only grants malaria-free certification when a country records zero cases transmitted within its borders for three consecutive years. WHO supported Paraguay’s efforts by helping to fund robust case management, community engagement, and training of front-line health workers. According to WHO’s Elimination 2020 initiative, 10 other countries are on track to be malaria-free in the next two years.
`

`In 2016, WHO identified Paraguay as one of 21 countries with the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. Through the "E-2020 initiative," WHO is supporting these countries as they scale up activities to become malaria-free. Other E-2020 countries in the Americas include Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico and Suriname.
`

`Paraguay has become the first country in the Americas to be declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization. The government of Paraguay and its health partners have worked hard to eliminate the mosquito-borne disease from the South American nation, which is home to more than seven million people. The effort to eradicate malaria in Paraguay began in the 1950s, but really took off in the early 2000s with the introduction of new drugs and improved insecticide treatments.
`

`In 2016, WHO identified Paraguay as one of 21 countries with the potential to eliminate malaria by the end of 2019, a goal set by the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on Improving Health Outcomes for Women, Children, and Adolescents (the global target for elimination of malaria in this age group). These countries were invited to join a process aimed at coordinating the steps needed to take malaria prevention efforts.
